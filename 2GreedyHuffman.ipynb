        "\n",
        "# 1. `HuffmanNode` Class:\n",
        "#    - Defines a node in the Huffman Tree with two attributes: `char` (the character) and `freq` (its frequency).\n",
        "#    - Includes the `__lt__` method, which allows nodes to be compared by frequency. This is essential for using\n",
        "#      a priority queue (min-heap), which organizes nodes by their frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. `build_huffman_tree` Function:\n",
        "#    - This function builds the Huffman Tree by using a greedy strategy.\n",
        "#    - First, it creates a priority queue (min-heap) containing all characters with their frequencies as individual nodes.\n",
        "#    - In each iteration, the two nodes with the smallest frequencies are removed from the heap, merged into a new node\n",
        "#      (whose frequency is the sum of the two), and added back into the heap. This merging process continues until only one node remains,\n",
        "#      representing the root of the Huffman Tree.\n",
        "#    - The final tree structure reflects the frequency of characters, where more frequent characters will have shorter paths (codes).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. `generate_huffman_codes` Function:\n",
        "#    - This function traverses the Huffman Tree to assign binary codes to each character.\n",
        "#    - It takes a `prefix` string to build the binary code as it recursively traverses left (adds '0') and right (adds '1').\n",
        "#    - When it reaches a leaf node (which holds a character), it assigns the generated prefix to that character in the `code_dict`.\n",
        "#    - The function returns `code_dict`, a dictionary where each character has its corresponding binary code.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. `huffman_encoding` Function:\n",
        "#    - This function ties together the whole encoding process.\n",
        "#    - First, it uses `Counter` to calculate the frequency of each character in the input text.\n",
        "#    - Then, it builds the Huffman Tree using `build_huffman_tree` and generates codes for each character using `generate_huffman_codes`.\n",
        "#    - Finally, it encodes the text by replacing each character in the original text with its corresponding Huffman code.\n",
        "#    - The function returns both the encoded text and the dictionary of Huffman codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Sample Usage:\n",
        "#    - The sample usage section defines a text to encode and then calls `huffman_encoding` to get the encoded text and Huffman codes.\n",
        "#    - It prints the original text, the encoded text, and the Huffman codes for each character.\n",
        "#    - This output demonstrates how Huffman Encoding compresses the text by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequent characters.\n",
