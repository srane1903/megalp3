        "\n",
        "# 1. Define the `Item` class:\n",
        "#    - This class represents each item with two attributes, `value` and `weight`, and a derived attribute `ratio`\n",
        "#      which is the value-to-weight ratio. This ratio is used to determine the relative worth of each item per unit of weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Define `fractional_knapsack` function:\n",
        "#    - Input: `capacity` (the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack) and a list of `items`.\n",
        "#    - Steps:\n",
        "#      a. Sort the list of items in descending order based on their value-to-weight ratio (`ratio`), using Python's sort function with a custom key.\n",
        "#         This greedy approach ensures that the most valuable items per unit of weight are considered first.\n",
        "#      b. Initialize `max_value` to zero. This will store the cumulative value of items added to the knapsack.\n",
        "#      c. Loop through the sorted items list:\n",
        "#         - If the current item can be fully added without exceeding `capacity`, add its full value to `max_value` and reduce the knapsack's `capacity`.\n",
        "#         - If only part of the item can be added (when the remaining capacity is less than the item's weight),\n",
        "#           calculate the partial value by multiplying the item's ratio by the remaining capacity. Add this to `max_value` and break the loop.\n",
        "#      d. Once the loop ends, the knapsack is either full or cannot accommodate any more items.\n",
        "#    - Output: Return `max_value`, which now holds the maximum achievable value.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Sample usage:\n",
        "#    - Creates three `Item` objects with values and weights and defines a knapsack capacity.\n",
        "#    - Calls `fractional_knapsack` with the `items` and `capacity` to compute the maximum possible value.\n",
        "#    - Prints the maximum value that can be achieved with the given items and capacity.\n"
